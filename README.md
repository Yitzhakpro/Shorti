## About the project
Shorti is a web application which used to shorten urls.
<br/>
Each user can create their own urls and they can view / edit / delete them and even watch how much they were being visited.
<br/>
All short urls are open to the public, anybody can use any redirect that exist, just like a regular url shortner.
